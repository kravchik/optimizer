## Welcome to GitHub Pages

## Disclaimer
Tool for automatic code optimization. Currently, it is best suited for math algorithm optimization - matrix, and vector math, for example.

## Optimization
### unroll cycles
   code examples
### calculate constants
   code examples
### inline methods, and objects
   code examples
### write simple code -> run effective code
   code examples

## Current features
- Optimization of Java code
- Optimization of CSharp code
- Code conversion Java <-> CSarp

## Current plans/todos
- add support for all the rare features of Java and CSharp (i.e., features, and syntax I don't see in my current tasks)
- Python parser/generator (optimization/conversion toolset will be available automatically, as it's language independent)
- C++ code generator

## State of the project
It is currently in a dormant mode. I'm using it for my projects, and add features as needed. If you are interested in it - e-mail me.




# TODO remove further

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kravchik/optimizer/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kravchik/optimizer/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
